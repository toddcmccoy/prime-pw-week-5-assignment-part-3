    <ul>
      <li>I'm not very happy with my findByArtist function. I feel like I am missing something that would make that code cleaner. <br>
      I think I am missing something simple that would allow me to use the 'album' object from 'addToCollection' without calling each item from the array. </li>
      <li>This week was challenging for me on many levels. On one hand I feel like a lot of the material has 'clicked' for me, nut I am aso getting nervous about moving in-person and maintaining obligations to the "outside world".<br>
      Don't get me wrong, I am very excited and loving Prime, just trying to be open about where I am at.</li>
